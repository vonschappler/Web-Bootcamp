    <h1>Who's von Schappler</h1>
    <p>
      I am an autistic individual, diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrom. Currently I am 40 years old and I am always trying to learn new things.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started working with programming at early ages, by making my own Pac-Man game to play on an aold IMB computer, at school, at the age of ten. Since then, I started to improve my knowledge about computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a Bsc. degree on computational Physics and worked with various programming/scriptting languages, such as C, Pascal, Fortan, GXC and everything that I know about web development was self learnt.<br/>
      Now I'm taking some online courses to both get updated with new development tech-stack and to have certificates to provide in case I need them.
