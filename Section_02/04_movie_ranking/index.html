<h2>Top 3 (2023/2024)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>For this one I won't pick a movie, but the whole trilogy - I just enjoyed the overall concept presented there, even though I think they went downwards on the last movie</p>
<h3>Death's Game</h3>
<p>Here I'm picking a serie. Even though this series contains too much graphical violence, the idea of living different lives that are part of the same universe is a great way to make us, as humans to start try looking on the other perspective</p>
<h3>Fallout</h3>
<p>This is another serie - the reason why this is here, it's beause I'm a fallout fan and the series really stood up my expectations of a what the Fallout universe would like if converted into a live-action</p>
