            I am a brazilian autistic individual, born in 1983, when that kind
            of diagnosis was not something that existed in the way we know about
            it today. Because of the lack of a proper diagnosis, I wasn't aware
            about the fact I'm autistic until a few years ago, when my nephew
            was disgnosed with autism and so was I, by his doctors. The
            treatment for autism here in Brazil is not something affordable and
            so, being aknowledge about the fact I'm autsitic just helped me to
            understand why I have some specific comportamental behavior traces
            that make me be who I am.
          </p>

          <p>
            My hyperfocus is centered into technology and science, and I always
            work hard to always give into that as much as I can. Because if
            <img

            />
            this, my first contact with a computer was when I was 10 years old,
            in a school specialized into dealing with gifted individuals (yes,
            that time, that was the diagnosis I received), where I wrote my
            first line of code, using <code>Cobol</code> to make a
            <strong>Pac-Man</strong> game which run from a 5.2" floppy disk in a
            old IBM computer. <br /><br />

            My Bsc. degree was attained on 2004, when I was 20 years old, on
            Computational Physics. My main area of work, back in the day, was
            physical phenomena simulation, with focus into Quantic Chaos, while
            studing the behavior of sub-atomic particles when those are confined
            within parabolic magnetic fields, using <code>Maple</code> (a
            programming language used by
            <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com" target="_blank">
              MapleSoft&trade; </a
            >), <code>C</code> and <code>OpenGL</code>, by creating applications
            to simulate their movement in a 3d field space. I also have used,
            when necessary, other programming languages such as
            <code>Pascal</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>Fortran</code> for
            smaller projects when I was still a member of the university
            students research team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also worked with geophysics, while creating data processing
            routines to optmize the already existing routines used generally by
            most of the Brazilian prospecting companies, while making use of the
            languages <code>GCX</code> and <code>GS</code> (used by
            <strong>Oasis Montaj</strong>, an applcation developed by
            <a href="https://www.seequent.com" target="_blank">Seequent</a> -
            formely known as Geosoft ).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010 I started streaming on
            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/von_schappler" target="_blank"
              >Twitch</a
            >, and that pushed me to a different road. That was where while
            trying to make something that would fit my standards, I learned some
            new skills to be used into my streams. It was when I started using
            <code>Python 2.7.13</code> to create add-ons to a chatbot
            application I use on my streams (<strong>Streamlab Chatbot</strong>)
            as well I decided taking some courses to work with
            <strong>graphical design</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From that day, I changed my main field of work from Physics to the
            graphical design market while also self-learning web development, by
            reading official documentaion over technologies used for web.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023 I decided to start taking online courses so I could attain
            more knowledge about web development and update / solidify the
            previous knowledge I had attained by self-learning, while creating a
            webdev portifolio and obtaning certificates.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also give private classes (over webdev) and have recently starting
            to work into content creation so I can provide courses into
            platforms such as Udemy, focusing on my main dev stack
            (<code>Noje.js</code>, <code>Postgres / Supabase</code>,
            <code>Material Ui</code>, <code>TailwindCss</code>,
            <code>React/Next.js</code> and <code>Electron.js</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            When not working, I take my free time to play some games, to stream
            (even though I have not streamed in a whike do the amount of work
            I'm doing recently) or to keep studying and learning more about the
            things that are related to my hyperfocus.

            <p>
              I have working with programming in general for a bit more than 20
              years. I started into this field (programming) with languages such
              as <code>C</code> (enhanced with OpenGL), <code>Fortran</code>,
              <code>Pascal</code>, <code>GXC / GS</code> (scriptting languages
              used specifically on Oasis Montaj - a geophysical data processing
              software developed by Geosoft Inc.), <code>Java</code>, an many
              other programming languages with specific use to physical
              phenomena and mathematics simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the last 5 years I have dedicated my mind space into
              learning new skills to improve my knowledge over programming in
              general. That lead me to a career change, from a former physicist
              to a webdeveloper. As part of my current skillset, technologies
              such as <code>Noje.js</code>, <code>Sequelize ORM</code>,
              <code>React.js</code> are being actively used in small / show case
              projects.

              Because of the constant updates to technoligy itself, sadly I
              don't have access to some of my old projects. Most of them are
              stored into the old <code>floppy disks</code>, but in my projects
              page, it's possible to see some projectes that were created while
              I was taking online courses, as well as some other public projects
              created for individuals.

              Also it's possible to have access to my

              some design projects.
